/Users/uesu/Dropbox/dextra/insights/insights.0100.byScore.md:2: Misplaced align
ment tab character &.
l.2 author: Wesley &
                     Ritika
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
