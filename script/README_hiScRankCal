To develop Rankings for Videos

1)Logic of Ranking
Rank = f(Score, frequency)
Score -> represents how much the video was watched
Frequency -> how many people watched the video

2) Methodology

a. Take all HighScore Viewers (top 20percentile with scores from [20 to 224])
b. Assigned a new scoring system based on 
    Score 1: mv_ratio < 20
    Score 2: mv_Ratio >=20 & mv_ratio < 50
    Score 3: mv_ratio >=50 & mv_ratio <80
    Score 4: mv_ratio >=80
    Logic: videos watched > 50% (in duration) are likely to be more interesting as compared to videos watched < 50% (duration)
c. calculate Ranks:
    sigma(weight*#views for each score group)* (views with score>=3)
    = ( %views(Score1)*1 +%views(Score2)*2 + %views(Score3)*3 + %views(Score4)*4 ) * (#views(Score3 + Score4))


Please Note:
1) In Ranking calculation the weighted score is further multiplied by #score3&4 views to give more importance to the longer views
2) we have compared teh rankings calculated for the entire pool of highScore Users and separately for HighScoreHifrequency Users and they were almost similar. Hence the ranks calculated overall were taken.
